# Air Quality Prediction

## Overview

The Air Quality Prediction project is a robust system designed to provide accurate pollutant concentrations, meteorological conditions, and other relevant parameters. Using Python, Flask, SQL Database, and XAMPP servers, this tool predicts air quality data for a specific day. Users can register and log in to view the Air Quality Index (AQI) level and related data, visualized through graphs and indexes.

## Key Components

- **Python Flask**: The project leverages Flask, a web framework in Python, to create a user-friendly web interface. Flask enables seamless integration of machine learning models and data visualization components.
  
- **SQL Database**: An SQL database is implemented to store and manage the vast amounts of environmental data needed for accurate predictions, ensuring efficient data retrieval and storage.
  
- **XAMPP Servers**: XAMPP is used to create a local server environment, allowing for the hosting of the Flask application and the SQL database, ensuring a smooth deployment process.

- **Data Visualization**: The project incorporates data visualization techniques, utilizing charts and graphs to help users interpret predicted air quality trends.

## Features

- User registration and login functionality
- Display of Air Quality Index (AQI) levels
- Visual representation of air quality data through graphs
- Predictions of air quality data for a specified day

## Future Enhancements

The project lays the foundation for future enhancements, including:

- Integration of external APIs for real-time data updates
- Expansion of machine learning models for improved accuracy
- Incorporation of advanced data analytics techniques

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Air-Quality-Prediction.git
  ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
  ```bash
  cd Air-Quality-Prediction
  ```
3. **Install required Python packages**:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
4. **Set up XAMPP: Ensure that XAMPP is installed and running on your local machine. Create a new database and configure the connection     settings in the Flask application.
    Set Flask environment variables and run the application**:
  ```bash
  set FLASK_APP=app.py
  set FLASK_DEBUG=1
  flask run -p 5505
  ```
After starting, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5505 to access the application.
Conclusion

This Air Quality Prediction project demonstrates the integration of Python, Flask, SQL Database, and XAMPP servers to create a powerful and user-centric tool for predicting and visualizing air quality. It addresses current environmental challenges and sets the stage for continuous improvement and innovation in predicting air quality levels.
