# Air-Quality-Prediction
This project is a robust Air Quality Prediction system using Python, Flask, SQL Database, and XAMPP servers. The aim was to create a tool that provides accurate pollutant concentrations, meteorological conditions, and other relevant parameters and broad Data about different air polluting substances like sulphurs and Nitrogen compounds present in air from the dataset and also predicts the data for a particular day,
A new user can register themselves and login to see the Air Quality Index(AQI) level and other related data with the help of graphs and indexes. 

Key Components:

Python Flask:
The project leverages Flask, a web framework in Python, to create a user-friendly web interface. Flask enables seamless integration of machine learning models and data visualization components.
SQL Database:
I implemented an SQL database to store and manage the vast amounts of environmental data needed for accurate predictions. This ensures efficient data retrieval and storage.
XAMPP Servers:
XAMPP is employed for creating a local server environment. This allows for the hosting of the Flask application and the SQL database, ensuring a smooth deployment process.

Data Visualization:
To enhance user understanding, the project incorporates data visualization techniques. Charts and graphs help users interpret the predicted air quality trends.

Future Enhancements:
The project lays the foundation for future enhancements, such as integrating external APIs for real-time data updates, expanding the machine learning models for improved accuracy, and incorporating advanced data analytics techniques.

Conclusion:
This Air Quality Prediction project demonstrates the integration of Python, Flask, SQL Database, and XAMPP servers to create a powerful and user-centric tool for predicting and visualizing air quality. It not only addresses the current environmental challenges but also sets the stage for continuous improvement and innovation in predicting air quality levels.
